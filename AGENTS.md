# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Agent Skills (OpenCode)

This project uses skills installed under `~/.config/opencode/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, invoke it with the `skill` tool before acting.
- Skills are located in `~/.config/opencode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Follow the skill workflow strictly; do not partially apply it.
- Never skip required steps such as spec, plan, or test when a skill demands them.

## Intent → Skill Mapping

Map the user's intent to the matching skill automatically:

- Feature / new functionality → `spec-driven-development`, then `incremental-implementation` and `test-driven-development`
- Planning / breakdown → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- Bug / failure / unexpected behavior → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Code review → `code-review-and-quality`
- Refactoring / simplification → `code-simplification`
- API or interface design → `api-and-interface-design`
- UI work → `frontend-ui-engineering`

## Execution Model

For every request:

1. Determine if any skill applies (even a small chance).
2. Load the skill with `skill({ name: "<skill-name>" })`.
3. Follow the skill workflow exactly.
4. Only proceed to implementation once required steps are complete.
